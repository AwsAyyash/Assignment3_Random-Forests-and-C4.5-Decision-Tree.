# Assignment3_Random-Forests-and-C4.5-Decision-Tree.

This is my work for the 3rd assignment of the machine learning course - 2022:

Q1) Bagging and Boosting are two methods for ensemble learning algorithms. Please answer the following:
a. What is Random Forest?
b. What is Boosting?
c. Explain in your own words the difference between Random Forests and XGBoost.

Q2) In this part, you will experiment the difference in the behavior of Random Forests and C4.5 Decision Tree. You have to report the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Score, Bias, and the Variance of each.
Use the following binary-class dataset (https://www.dropbox.com/s/8r3nfghlhg96n63/COMP4388-Dataset1.csv?dl=0). Split the data 80 training/20 test and explain the steps of your work (i.e., if you scale data, how did you split, the performance measures, bias and variance, and state your findings in your own words). You have to provide your Python code as well.
